Does Python need yet another retry / poll library?
It needs at least one that isn't coupled to decorators and functions.
Decorators prevent the caller from customizing delay options.
And even organizing the code around functions prevents custom handling of failures.

Waiter is built around iteration instead, because the foundation of retrying / polling is a slowly executing loop.
The resulting interface is both easier to use and more flexible,
decoupling the delay algorithms from the application logic.

Usage
=========================
Supply a number of seconds to repeat endlessly, or any iterable of seconds.

.. code-block:: python

   from waiter import wait

   wait(1)              # 1, 1, 1, 1, ...
   wait([1] * 3)        # 1, 1, 1
   wait([0.5, 0.5, 60]) # circuit breaker

So any delay algorithm is easily created,
but constructors for common algorithms are also provided.

.. code-block:: python

   wait(1) + 1       # incremental backoff 1, 2, 3, 4, ...
   w = wait(1) * 2   # exponential backoff 1, 2, 4, 8, ...
   w[:3]             # limit attempt count 1, 2, 4
   w <= 5            # set maximum delay   1, 2, 4, 5, 5, 5, ...
   w.random(-1, 1)   # add random jitter

Then simply use the ``wait`` object like any iterable, yielding the amount of elapsed time.
Timeouts also supported of course.

.. code-block:: python

   from waiter import wait, suppress, first

   for elapsed in wait(delays):           # first iteration is immediate
      with suppress(exception):           # then each subsequent iteration sleeps as necessary
         ...
         break

   for _ in wait(delays, timeout):        # standard convention for ignoring a loop variable
      ...                                 # won't sleep past the timeout
      if ...:
         break

   results = (... for _ in wait(delays))  # expressions are even easier
   first(predicate, results[, default])   # filter for first true item
   assert any(results)                    # perfect for tests too

Yes, functional versions are provided too, because now they're trivial to implement.

.. code-block:: python

   wait(...).throttle(iterable)                      # generate items from iterable
   wait(...).repeat(func, *args, **kwargs)           # generate results
   wait(...).retry(exception, func, *args, **kwargs) # return first success or re-raise exception
   wait(...).poll(predicate, func, *args, **kwargs)  # return first success or raise StopIteration

The decorator variants are simply partial applications of the corresponding methods.
Note decorator syntax doesn't support arbitrary expressions, hence the name assignment.

.. code-block:: python

   backoff = wait(0.1) * 2
   @backoff.repeating
   @backoff.retrying(exception)
   @backoff.polling(predicate)

But in the real world:

* the function may not exist or be succinctly written as a lambda
* the predicate may not exist or be succinctly written as a lambda
* logging may be required
* there may be complex handling of different exceptions or results

So consider the block form, just as decorators don't render ``with`` blocks superfluous.
Also note ``wait`` objects are re-iterable provided their original delays were.

In Python 3.6 or higher, waiters also support async iteration.
``throttle`` optionally accepts an async iterable.
``repeat``, ``retry``, and ``poll`` optionally accept coroutine functions.
